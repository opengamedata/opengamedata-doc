Chapter 2: Installation
===============================================

Before you can use OpenGameData, you'll need to install a couple tools.

Firstly, OpenGameData is implemented in Python, which means you'll need a Python interpreter to run the code, which in turn means you need to have Python installed on your system.

Second, you must determine whether you will run OpenGameData from an installed Python package, or from a local source copy.
